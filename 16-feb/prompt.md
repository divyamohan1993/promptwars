At anytime strictly ensure to score full marks on these parameters:

1. Code Quality: structure, readability, maintainability
2. Security: safe and responsible implementation
3. Efficiency: optimal use of resources
4. Testing: validation of functionality
5. Accessibility: inclusive and usable design
6. Google Services: meaningful integration of Google Services
      

I have a hackathon in progress. PromptWars. Creatively think of some game and ensure to score full marks on the evaluation parameters. 

Here is the problem statement:

Reimagine the game the way you wished it to be & create your own version today.
Take a game that defined your childhood and reimagine it in 2026. We don't want a clone; we want an evolution. Your goal is to build a web application that captures the spirit of the original game but utilizes Gemini capabilities to create an experience that wasn't possible 20 years ago.


Find some game which was being played and add curiosity and vibes and think creatively on how to make that game more better. It will be deployed on cloud run. 


Your solution should demonstrate:

Ability to build a smart, dynamic assistant
Logical decision making based on user context
Effective use of Google Services
Practical and real-world usability
Clean and maintainable code
Participants must choose one of the provided challenge verticals and design their solution around that persona and logic.

The total code size must be less than 10 MB. 

A README needs to be present explaining: 
Your chosen vertical
Approach and logic
How the solution works
Any assumptions made

Codes will be evaluated on
Code Quality: structure, readability, maintainability
Security: safe and responsible implementation
Efficiency: optimal use of resources
Testing: validation of functionality
Accessibility: inclusive and usable design
Google Services: meaningful integration of Google Services

At anytime ensure to score full marks on them. 

First find an easy game which you want to work on and how can it be creatively reimaged using all those google services. Its a 20 year leap. Find a game first.
