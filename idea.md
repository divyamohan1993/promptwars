# QuestForge - AI-Powered Text Adventure

## Game Choice: Text Adventure / Choose Your Own Adventure

### Why This Game?
Text adventure games (Zork, Choose Your Own Adventure books) defined a generation of gaming.
Every kid in the 80s-2000s either played text adventures on computers or read CYOA books.
The limitation was always fixed storylines - once you read all paths, the game was over.

### The 2026 Reimagination

- Never repeat the same story twice
- Respond to creative free-form player input (not just preset choices)
